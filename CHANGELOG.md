# Changelog

> **Latest Version:** v1.0.1 (April 20, 2026)

All notable changes to this project are recorded in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **Bundle urllib3 locally**: Bundled urllib3 1.26.12 into addon to fix LibreELEC compatibility. Removed external `script.module.urllib3` dependency since minimal Kodi distros may not have it installed. urllib3 is now included in `resources/lib/` and imported locally before `requests` initialization.


## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Token-Based OAuth2 Authentication**: Secure PKCE-based login flow with automatic token refresh. Sessions persist across Kodi restarts via cookie storage.
- **Dialog-Based Login**: Modern Kodi dialog login interface — credentials are never exposed in addon settings menu for better security and UX.
- **Optional Credential Storage**: Users choose between "Save tokens only" (recommended, requires login only when tokens expire) or "Save email+password" (auto-refresh convenience).
- **Auto-Token Refresh**: Sessions automatically refresh when tokens expire with 60-second proactive buffer. Fallback to form login if refresh fails, with user re-login prompt.
- **Dynamic Login/Sign Out Button**: Main menu displays "Login" when not authenticated and "Sign Out" when user has active session.
- **Protected Content Menu**: Series, Movies, TV Shows, Search, and My List menu items hidden for unauthenticated users.
- **Logout Confirmation Flow**: Two-step logout with optional "Keep My List" to preserve favorites after sign out.
- **Live TV EPG Display**: Current program ("Nu live") and next program ("Straks") now display in channel descriptions with broadcast times (HH:MM-HH:MM).
- **Global API Instance Caching**: 5-minute TTL cache reduces initialization overhead and disk I/O on every menu interaction.
- **Fast EPG Channel Cache**: 45-second cache for channel menu EPG to reduce load time while keeping data fresh.
- **Smart Artwork by Aspect Ratio**: Automatically separates and assigns images based on aspect ratio — landscape (16:9) for fanart, portrait (2:3) for covers, preventing face-cutting.
- **High-Resolution Fanart Images**: Image URLs now request 3840px width from the NLZiet image service, rendering crisp 4K-quality artwork instead of pixelated thumbnails.
- **Kodi Fanart Support**: Added addon fanart metadata and menu-level fanart assignment so skins can render `resources/media/background.jpg` when opening/browsing the addon.
- **Logout Icon Asset**: Added dedicated `menu_logout.png` and wired main menu logout item to prefer this asset.
- **Converted Localization Catalogs**: Added `resource.language.en_gb/strings.po` and `resource.language.nl_nl/strings.po` for converted settings string resolution.
- **InputStream Helper Integration**: Uses `script.module.inputstreamhelper` v0.6.0 for DRM verification before playback. Ensures `inputstream.adaptive` and Widevine CDM are properly installed.

### Changed
- Authentication workflow completely redesigned: moved from settings-based credentials to secure dialog-based OAuth2 flow.
- API instance creation now centralized via `get_api_instance()` function with caching logic for 15+ menu functions.
- Image optimization function now requests 3840px width instead of stripping parameters, ensuring high-quality fanart display.
- Context menu items now use cached API instances instead of creating new NLZietAPI objects per item interaction.
- Settings now run in Dutch-only mode for addon settings UI: removed language switch controls and language-dependent branching in settings label paths.
- Localization layout migrated from legacy `resources/language/English|Dutch/strings.xml` to Kodi resource language folders.
- Service wrapper simplified to a minimal monitor loop; removed language-change monitor/state persistence logic.
- Addon metadata now keeps Dutch summary/description only.
- EPG labels now use Dutch localization ("Nu live" and "Straks") for consistency with user preferences.

### Fixed
- **EPG Data Missing on Live TV**: Fixed parsing of nested channel/programLocations API response structure. Program titles, times, and descriptions now correctly extract from nested content objects.
- **Wrong Program Showing on Live TV**: Fixed EPG selection logic to prioritize currently-playing programs over future/past programs.
- **Context Menu on Live TV**: Prevented Kodi's "Resume from" and "Play from beginning" context menu options from appearing on live channels. Live streams now play directly via `ResumeTime`, `TotalTime`, and `IsLive` properties.
- **Performance Delay on Live TV Cancel**: Removed unnecessary 1-second sleep and per-channel fallback logic that caused delays when canceling playback.
- **Channel Menus 404 Errors**: Channel menus no longer generate 404 errors from unsupported `/v9/content/detail` endpoint.
- **Image Aspect Ratio Issues**: Image aspect ratio correctly preserved in Kodi artwork keys — landscape images no longer assigned to portrait keys and vice versa.
- **Pixelated Fanart Images**: Small fanart now requests higher resolution from API (3840px), eliminating zoom/crop appearance on large screens.
- **Slow Menu Response**: Menu response time reduced from 2-3 seconds to near-instant for context operations (Add/Remove My List).
- **Undefined Variable References (#8)**: Fixed undefined reference to series_detail() in series listing; removed erroneous per-series season fallback attempt from functions that don't operate on individual series IDs.
- **Missing/Blank Settings Labels**: Fixed by keeping converted `version="1"` settings structure and providing matching string IDs in resource language catalogs.
- **Inconsistent Settings Language Rendering**: Fixed by using Dutch labels in both fallback catalogs.
- **Token Refresh Without Refresh_Token**: Implemented PKCE-based fallback renewal when refresh_token is unavailable, using preserved cookie session to silently re-authorize.

### Notes
- OAuth2 PKCE flow ensures secure token exchange without exposing client secrets.
- Cookie-based session persistence uses HTTP LWP format for cross-session recognition with ~30 day lifetime (idsrv cookie).
- Token expiry buffer set to 60 seconds for proactive refresh before actual expiration.
- `resources/settings.xml` remains in converted format (`<settings version="1">` + section/category/group/setting/control hierarchy) per Kodi conversion guidance.
- InputStream Helper checks are performed before DRM playback to ensure dependencies are available.

## [0.0.7] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- Persist cookie-based login across Kodi restarts so the add-on recognizes logged-in sessions.

### Changed
- Bumped addon version to `0.0.7` and created release zip package.

### Fixed
- Minor fixes and packaging updates.

----

## [0.0.5] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- Landscape thumbnail picker: introduced `_pick_landscape_thumb` to select the best landscape-oriented artwork.

### Changed
- Updated `browse_series`, `show_series_season`, and `do_search` to utilize the new thumbnail picker.
- Enhanced `get_series_list` and `get_series_episodes` in `NLZietAPI` for improved data retrieval and increased limits.

### Notes
- See commit 41af5e0 for implementation details and code-level changes.

----

## [0.0.4] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- Grouped search folders: search now presents per-group folders (e.g. "Series: X", "Movies: X") when results span multiple groups.
- `search_group` route to view results filtered to a single group.
- Landscape thumbnail selection helper (`_pick_landscape_thumb`) to prefer wide/landscape artwork.

### Changed
- Episode labeling prefers `S{n}:A{m}` subtitle codes and uses the subtitle remainder as the episode title when present; falls back to subtitle-only or the API formatted label.
- Menu icons now prefer bundled PNGs first; inactive profiles use the bundled inactive icon.
- Active profile stays highlighted (green) until another is selected; profile changes use `Container.Update(...,replace)` to avoid history cycling.
- HTTP debug logging is now gated behind the `debug_http` setting.

### Fixed
- Search presentation and routing refinements; clearer grouping and improved fallback behavior.

----

## [0.0.2] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- Implemented Search for Series and Movies — results now route to series folders or playable Movie/Episode items.
- Search requests send repeated `contentType` params (`contentType=Movie&contentType=Series`).
- Search sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>` when available and will attempt PKCE authorize+exchange using the saved cookie session.
- `X-Profile-Id` header is included when a profile is selected.

### Fixed
- Search routing fixed: Series open series detail, Movies/Episodes play correctly.
- Fallback search added using series/movies/channels endpoints when primary search returns no results.

### Changed
- Addon version bumped to `0.0.2`.

### Fixed / Notes
- Improved token/cookie handling and added a PKCE fallback to exchange cookie sessions for tokens when needed.
- Various UI and parsing improvements: thumbnail selection, expiry formatting, and defensive API parsing.
